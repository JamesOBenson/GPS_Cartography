# GPS_Cartography
Take a single GPS point, plot a radius around it in google maps, and potentially a drivable route.

While a Google API key is not necessary for this code to work, if you would like to plot a driving path, you will need one.
To obtain an API key, follow googles instructions here:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

The final result are images such as:

*Figure 1: GPS Coordinates with 2 mile ring around it*
